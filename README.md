**FEATURES**
- Log in/sign up (you don't need to know login or sign up a new account, account details are hard coded into login screen)
- Main table view displaying your current bets
- Main table view also displays bottom tab bar
- Ability to add a new bet to the data base, currently only inputting title and bet question

**BUGS**
- I didn't figure out yet how to add an action to a TAB bar button, so I just added a regular button on top of it so i could get some functionality
- Right now the table view displays ALL bets in the database, not just bets specifically tied to you
